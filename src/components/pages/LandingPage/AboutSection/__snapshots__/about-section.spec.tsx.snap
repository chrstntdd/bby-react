    About Quantified
  </h1>
  <blockquote>
    "A streamlined system for efficiently and accurately managing retail inventory."
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    That sounds great and all, but what does that mean exactly? Imagine for a moment that you are in a retail setting. When shipments of products come into your store, they will be accompanied by a manifest that notates exactly what products and how many of them were put onto the trailer when it left the distribution center. It is the job of one employee to verify everything listed on the manifest actually makes it to the store, not an easy or quick task by any means.
  </p>
  <p>
    The previous workflow (at least at Best Buy) for counting all of these products involved printing out a copy of the aforementioned manifest, then tallying up the products one by one. Sounds monotonous and error prone right? That's where Quantified comes in to save the day by bearing the responsibility of accounting for everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of manually counting each product, Quantified allows the user to simply scan the bar code of the product and automatically populates all of its relevant information into a row in a table. From there, after everything has been scanned, the table can be formatted to mirror the manifest and printed for seamless comparison with the manifest for the final verification.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, Quantified is built with battle tested and industry leading technology as well as the Best Buy API. All together this yields unmatched dependability, speed, and security.
